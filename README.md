# Phrase Hunter
This console based game challenges the user to guess all of the letters in a phrase. Each time they make a guess they will be told whether the letter the picked is in the phrase. The goal is to solve the phrase before having five incorrect tries.

## Motivation
This is my take on the third project in Treehouse's Python Techdegree program.

## Features
* When the game begins players are welcomed, shown the number of missed, misses remaining, and the phrase
* Players use the console to guess a letter
* The player is notified whether or not the guessed letter is in the phrase and if it is, it is the displayed phrase is updated to reveal the letters
* The player is prompted to keep guessing letters until they have either revealed all of the letters in the phrase or had five incorrect guesses.
* When the game ends the player a message is displayed and the player is given the option to play again.
* If the player's guess is not a single upper or lower case letter an exception is raised
* If they enter anything besides an upper or lower case Y or N in the play again input an exception is raised

## Future Improvements
* Add colors to terminal output
